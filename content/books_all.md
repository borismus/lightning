Finite and Infinite Games by James Carse (no)
===
posted: May 2017

I was intrigued by the premise of the book, which introduces a theory of games
(emphatically not the game theory of economics), in which there are two kinds of
games: short, well defined finite ones where the goal is to win, and infinite,
rule-bendy ones where the goal is to keep playing. Great premise but I couldn't
get into it.  Despite being only ~100 small, sparse pages, I had to cut it off
after about twenty. Here's why:

> "Dramatically, one chooses to be a mother; theatrically, one takes on the role
> of mother." 

Is this profound or what? My impression is that the author is a deliberate
obscurantist. The whole book reads like a collection of Zen koans. But unlike
koans, which are simple on the surface but attempt conceal something profound,
the surface level is also very dense. The author casually cites Plato, Freud,
Hegel Marx, Jesus, Sartre, Thoreau, Shaw, Proust, etc. The book is full of
passages like the above that are meaningless without defining terms precisely.

Further, the author babbles a lot about theory, rarely producing actual examples
of infinite games. Presumably life is an infinite game, but are there other
examples? What good is a grand theoretical framework that only has one instance?
Lastly, given the author's definition, infinite games seem hardly game-like at
all.


Homo Deus by Harari (yes, if you haven't read Sapiens)
===
posted: May 2017

I decided to read Homo Deus because I enjoyed Harari's previous book, Sapiens.
The first 2/3 of Homo Deus is basically a rehash and more succinct version of
his previous book. Despite the repetition, I got a lot out of it, mainly because
I listened to Sapiens, so my retention was pretty bad. The last third of the
book was very speculative.

Interesting things from the recap:

- In 2016, war killed 120k, crime 500k, suicide 800k, diabetes 1500k.
- Well stated paradox of knowledge using Marx as an example. Specifically
  communist revolutions never came to the western world because its leaders had
  read Marx. 
- Also this logic conveniently defends Homo Deus existence as a way of avoiding
  the future it describes. But also of obviating the author from any
  responsibilities. Smart :)
- Big claim that in 1016 Europe people knew what 1050 would be like (but not 2016,
  2050). Not sure if this is just hindsight bias. 
- Nice crisp description of intersubjectivity, better than in sapiens. 
- Claim: religion is for control, science is for power. I agree, except
  s/science/engineering/.
- The Vatican was once an institution for technological progress, a Silicon Valley
  type institution. Monasteries did contribute quite a bit to tech innovation,
  even recently (e.g. Mendel)

Even in the summary, Harari goes on some bizarre but interesting tangents:

- Several pages railing against lawns. They are purely status symbols and have
  no practical value.
- Snakes as ancestors. Dragons as wise creatures. Rainbow Serpents of Australian
  Aborigines. Eve as a snake. Garden of eden as an anti animist fable.
- The Garden of Woolsthorpe (where Newton's apple accident occurred) as a
  founding Myth paralleling the garden of eden. This is where newton had his
  kinematic revelation. Except rather than being punished for his curiosity like
  Adam and Eve were, we have modern science. 
- Why do we have consciousness when there are so many automatic processes that are
  handled by the body and the brain without any conscious intervention?
- Weird and tenuous analogy of gods to corporations. Corporations actually
  produce output like a product or service but gods are purely fictional. 
- Judge systems from without. For example a corporation thrives if it makes a lot
  of money. But that's not why corporations exist. 

To transition from the summary to the meat of the book (speculating about the
future), Harari rehashes his branches of humanism:

- liberal: equality for all, economically artistically etc
- social: socialism and communism. Deference to the group. 
- evolutionary: belief in superiority of some over others. 

My critique: this is too broad. Humanism seems to include everything that is
non-religious. Because either God is the main thing or humans are the main
thing. Are there other better alternatives? Maybe with Zen Buddhism? 

Harari then dives into an overly stark analysis of the weakness of liberalism.
As if the only US allies were dictators during post war period. Not true! Most
of Europe was liberal. And although the Soviet Union was critical in defeating
Nazi Germany, liberal Allies did play a huge role too. Harari then goes into
counterfactuals, suggesting that social humanism (communism) defeated
evolutionary humanism (Nazism) in World War II, and that the Cold War didn't
turn Hot because of mutually assured destruction due to nukes. 

## Last third

The book really begins in Chapter 8, where Harari jumps headlong into future
speculation.  It's unclear to me why Harari jumps to some post humanist fantasy.
Currently we are seeing the resurgence of "evolutionary humanism" in the form of
authoritarian regimes. 

Harari is clearly not an expert in AI and overly optimistic about it. He claims
that"computers programmed with ethical algorithms could far more easily conform
to the latest rulings of the international criminal court."

On replacing service type jobs, especially in medicine, over optimism. People
like dealing with people. And the supposedly empathetic machine is still a long
ways off. Even in the case of near perfect replication, I think acknowledging
consciousness and experience on the other side goes a long way. 

More reductionist thinking: biology is just an algorithm and we can do
algorithms. Yes it is but the devil is in the details. 

He cites a Frey and Osborne study which suggests that all sorts of jobs are
going away. A twenty year horizon cannot reasonably have such precise
probabilities. And many problems with specifics. 98% Sports referee jobs to go
obsolete by 2033? Sure we can tell fowls through video. Who will prevent fights?
Who will make difficult calls? Seems like bullshit. 

On self knowledge again Harari goes too far by claiming that your self is the
sum of your biometric data. As long as we don't divulge everything to the
machine, aren't we quite far from this vision? I am surprised that a deep
meditator like the author believes this.

Harari lists several threats to liberalism posed by this hypothetical future
thing:

One threat is that we will lose our agency and become agents of some networked
machine. This is terrifying. We may need some anti-tech revolution to prevent
this. Also it's unclear what the scope would be. I'd like to always be able to
disconnect and go into nature. 

Another threat is that the rich will become increasingly intelligent, healthy,
successful, further separating the gap between the rich and the poor.  I believe
that if things get bad enough, the population at large will rebel and
redistribute the spoils more evenly. 

Here's why. In established first world countries, the rich know how to behave.
They rarely flaunt their money and mostly blend in with the rest of the world.
I think this is largely a self-preserving strategy. Many of those that don't
follow it aren't respected by giant swaths of the population. For example overly
flashy people are generally considered to be douchebags. Trump is an aberration
and widely hated. Now imagine if he was also some superhuman demigod. Would his
supporters be into that? If a tiny clique of people were visibly richer
healthier, people would rebel. 

I think Harari a third point is only viable in an dystopian oligarchy. And if
people have become completely useless, why would some small elite group of
humans still hold the reigns? This scenario folds into the superintellihgence
one. 

We use machine strength and machine intelligence augmented tools all the time.
Harari seems to be obsessed with the neural augmentation aspect, but is this
such a game changer?

Good points that are hard to argue against: human loss of smell, attention,
ability to dream. I seek to get it all back. But I wonder: were these all things
that came naturally to everybody in some long forgotten utopia, or did rare
individuals have to work on developing these skills for themselves while the
rest of the population plowed the field or caught the deer? 

- Dreaming: It's no accident that Joseph's dream interpretation was so rare and
  that there were commonly priest classes for interfacing with dreams
- Smelling: yes seems likely that the masses of the day: hunters and farmers
  needed this more long ago. 
- Attention: also an elite skill I think. We are In an age of distraction but
  attention today is more needed than ever before. Attention for a hunter was
  focused with adrenaline. Focusing otherwise is and probably was rare. 

The focus on technology changing our minds and wills seems premature. And by the
way this is why I think SSRIs are a slippery slope. Maybe the google normal
health index can serve as some humanistic baseline for human norms?

The last section is entirely focused on "Dataism". It sounds like he's
describing information theory. I suppose any discipline can already be viewed
through that lens. Except is that activity likely going to produce useful
results? Empirical evidence from science points to no. 

Harari claims that the phrase "information wants to be free" means that
the information itself is the actor. This is surprising, since the phrase is not
meant to be taken literally, used as a slogan about increasing human access to
information. A cult of information worship for its own sake? I don't think this
makes sense without actual value to an actual human.

Harari has so far failed to explain who believes in dataism. Maybe some people
in SV appear to, but IoT usually has some actual purpose, like for example,
making things easier to use, or increasing productivity of a farm or factory.
If you lose the thread, you end up with tech for tech's sake (an existing
problem).

Also Harari's stance on the instagram sharing thing is really cynical. Yes
sharing with others is part of it. But many people have taken photos in the
past, for themselves and their friends.  It's clear to me that the value of
Human experience is inherent. Some people are overly addicted to external
validation, but this too is an existing problem.

Throughout the book Harari judiciously uses the word "may". This is good because
man the last third especially is just chock full of wild speculation.  It
strikes me that the way to read this book is as a provocation. Overall I'm left
with the feeling that this was a fast follow for Harari. A lot of the solid
stuff in the first 2/3 of the book is a rehash of Sapiens. The last part was
stimulating but mainly to get me thinking about why I disagree. 


Understanding Japan: A Cultural History (Yes, audio)
===
posted: April 2017

Overall an engaging lecturer and super interesting subject. Would have greatly
informed my trips to Japan. Most of these are quick notes about things that were
new to me:

Lots about Buddhism:

- There's a super interesting argument that the fact that Shinto traditions are
  completely illogical is proof of the divine origin of those teachings. 
- There were multiple streams of Buddhism commonly practices in early Japan. Pure
  Land Buddhism is very similar to Christianity's because of the centrality of
  salvation through belief. Also there are multiple streams of Zen Buddhism. One
  focuses on koans and the other focuses on meditation.
- Key idea of zen gardens is that you get a new view from every step in the
  path. This is a metaphor for human nature, which is prone to seeing the world
  very differently depending on emotional state. Constant reminder about the
  limitation of the senses. 
- In Pure Land Buddhism, gardens include a bridge to paradise. Dry landscaping.

Politics:

- "Tycoon" comes from tai + kun, a made up title (great lord) for the Japanese
  Emperor as a result of a Japanese-Korean treaty. It was invented to avoid direct
  vassalage to the Ming. 
- Interesting oscillation between isolationism and globalism. 1600-1860 was
  complete isolation. Hardly knew about the pre-WW2 Japan with Manchurian
  ambitions.

Arts

- Apparently the tea ceremony inspired the English Arts and Crafts movement.
  Also a part of minimalism. (Check out Okakuro's "The Book of Tea" from 1906). 
- (Check out Nou theater but it's unclear if I'll be able to follow it. Not much
  interest in Kabuki.)
- Haiku is young. Started in 1890. Fascinating idea of pivot words: homonyms that
  can be used just once but translated into multiple of its meanings. Also renga
  is an interesting chain of poems each written by another poet. 
- Hokusai invented the comic book. What. 

Lecturer provides a good summary of why he is interested in Japan: it's
incredibly interesting and exotic, but still has enough western services.


The Lessons of History by Will and Ariel Durant (Yes)
====
posted: March 2017


This book attempts to distill authors' previously written and incredibly popular
multi-tome historical "The Story of Civilization" into under 100 pages. Full
disclaimer: I haven't read the original. I found this one is a bit of a mixed
bag. Overall, I say read it, since it's so short (~100 short pages).  I found
the flourishing writing style and strong opinions sometimes leads to funny dated
read. Similar in some ways to Jacob Bronowski writing. 


Random but interesting ideas:

- Freedom and equality are at odds. 
- Authors seem to rely on group selection. Still unclear what I think about the
  idea. 
- Interesting coverage of the great man theory of history. A nod to both the
  causes of greatness in the environment and also personal originality that can
  bridge gaps.
- Also insight into the yin yang nature of liberal vs conservative
  thought. 
- Interesting that Rome took 500 years to collapse from its nadir in 60 BCE.
- Revolutions rarely succeed in redistributing wealth, mainly in destroying it.
- In Chapter X, authors express concern about a despot ruining America democracy.

A lot of interesting thinking on morality and history:

- In general the idea that morality follows the times.
- Intimate relationship between Bible and agriculture. Biblical morals developed
  to help with agriculture, and have deteriorated as a result of industry. 
- Was every vice once a virtue? Pugnacity, brutality, greed, and sexual readiness
  were virtues for the hunter age.
- The idea that most times in history have been full of sin. Examples from the
  Renaissance.

Some things that felt dated and detracted from the experience:

- The chapters are mostly named "History and ___". This obtuse naming gets old
  quickly, and skimming the contents is completely useless.
- The authors make predictions that geography no longer matters because
  airplanes, completely ignoring reality of efficiency. They end pompously on
  "man, not earth, makes civilization"
- At some points the authors express fear that Catholics will take over US
  politics. This is likely top of mind for the authors writing the book the
  Kennedy era. I looked up the authors' religious affiliations and they come from
  a Jewish background (squee!)

The authors allude to some historical patterns:

- History that is written is different from history that is lived. 
- The church as an organization that stands above Christian nation states. Kind
  of like a religious version of the UN. Like an alternative to the international
  system. Except while the International System is really vague and doesn't really
  seem to have much power, the Church worked once.
- Prevalence of the cycle between religion and atheism. And I think that Sam
  Harris is wrong about the end of faith. 
- Cycles pervade economic inequality. This has a tendency to
  increase until the poor can't take it anymore and revolt. Or until the ruling
  class realizes and course corrects. 
- Now irrelevant but quite prescient that they would apply Hegelian thinking to
  industrialization. Meaning that industrialization is thesis, communism is
  antithesis and now we need a synthesis. (Evidence points to Liberal welfare
  states?)
- Again the idea of compensation and balance in a great quote from Plato
  "dictatorship naturally arises out of democracy and the most aggravated fork of
  tyranny and slavery out if the most extreme fork of liberty."
- Monarchy - aristocracy - democracy - dictatorship (and so on). Cycle appears
  over and over in history.

Civilizations don't die completely. There are more readers of Homer today than
ever before.
